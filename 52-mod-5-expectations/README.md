# Mod 5 Expectations

This document outlines the main talking points that should be brought to the attention of students during their "What to expect when you are expecting mod5 talk". We have had the talk on the thur/fri before mod5 start with cohorts as well as on the first Monday of mod5.

## How is Module 5 different?

* Unlike mod 1-4, mod5 is self led
* There is less structure to each day re: what and when to learn/spend time programming is dictated by the student
* The mindeset a student should have is that they, not instructors, are the experts on their respective projects
* Requests for help have to be thoroughly formulated -- instructors won't have the context of the curriculum and labs to help troubleshoot many of the more difficult hurdles \(this ultimately helps students learn how to think through, communicate and lead conversations regarding the challenges they encounter\)

## Goal of Module 5

* Create your most significant portfolio piece
* Transition to a workflow that reflects a work environment as opposed to an academic environment
* Students learn to answer their own programming questions
* Students put the skills they learned in the previous modules to use
* Transition from the mindset of a student to that of a programmer
* Seek guidance/project management from instructors instead of "how-to" answers

## What are actions of a successful student in Module 5?

* Attendance \(on time -- arriving before 9:20\). Senioritis often sets in during mod5 so it is important to schedule standups in the morning to prevent students from rolling in to class at increasingly later times.
* Seek resources independently - exhausting attempts to solve their own problems before escalating to an instructor
  * If a student comes to you for help with a `cannot read property 'map' of undefined` error, ask them to debug on their own. Students should be able to solve this bug by now and need to be told to do so.
  * A _good_ question to bring to an instructor: 'my users are logged out whenever I refresh the page or a component I think should be rendered by react router is not mounting or rendering properly.'
* Thorough pre-planning/architecting of projects and _sticking to the created plan_ as long as its applicable
* Time and expectation management - scaling down scope of project much more than students anticipate \(students consistently underestimate how long features will take to implement\). Daily goal setting/todo-list is very important!
  * For example, if a student says they want to build Super Smash Bros in React VR and learn Node during mod5 this is a good opportunity to step in and scope them down. Encourage your students to come up with a list of stretch goals beyond a scoped-down MVP.
* Pre-plan what you want to be spending your time developing and identify potential time sinks \(i.e. over-styling, a poorly documented framework, etc.\)
  * The Facebook, Twitter, and Spotify APIs will usually eat up around 2-3 days of a student's time and they should plan accordingly.
* Using the tools we have taught instead of branching out to a new framework \(i.e. rails instead of starting anew with a MERN stack\). Students can learn new libraries that they want to employ in their projects -- allow new frameworks to solve problems/features that we have not provided an alternative to during the curriculum \(Take websockets for example, which is a very popular choice. Unless they have good reason not to, students should seek to use websockets within Rails action cable framework before trying to implement express-ws or socket.io on a node backend.\)
* Build a solid and **simple** MVP with clean code. Features will be added more smoothly if the foundation is strong!
* Critical reflection and evolution of/on individual debugging/problem solving method
* Critical reflection on the planning process and how closely it reflected the actual development of the project
* Students should think of module 5 more like a piano recital than a pitch to Shark Tank. The goal is to take the things they have learned over the last 12 weeks and execute. The app doesn't have to be the most groundbreaking or technologically advanced. It has to work and the student has to be able to talk about their project in an interview. Think of the MVP for Instagram––it's just a list of photos with some comments. This is not revolutionary technology, it's just a CRUD app with lists and forms.

## What are expectations of the Community to support each other’s work?

* Treat this like a work environment \(students should ask themselves: 'how do you want others to see you as a professional and what do you expect from professional colleagues'?\)
  * Students should hink of their instructors as senior developers on their team. They should onsult with peers and debug themselves before escalating an issue to an instructor. Ideally, students should ask for help once they've checked the docs, asked classmates, and googled around enough to have an idea of what the problem is but are unsure how to proceed. Students need to learn independence during mod5. The instructors are lifeguards but it's up to the students to keep themselves afloat.
* Students should be cognizant of their peers and creating a space in which everyone can concentrate
* Hold each other accountable for the type of work environment they all create
* When using a similar technology \(think using react google maps\) draw on each others knowledge to accelerate implementation speed
